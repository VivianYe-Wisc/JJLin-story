I am a singer. One day I realized my sanctuary. 

No, not the stage or the studio. A restaurant. 
I sang on their stage one night, and it smelled like beer and B.O.
But among the butt smell, I found a ray of sunshine.
No, like literally. The bartender wouldn't stop shining me in
the eyes with a laser pointer.
