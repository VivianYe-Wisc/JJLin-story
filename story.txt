I am a singer. One day I realizd my sanctuary. 


One day in college, the teacher had stapled answer sheets to the back of every test by mistake. A few minutes after passing the tests around, his phone rang and he stepped out. Everyone had noticed the answer sheet, and we decided that we would all use it and tear it off after. Hopefully he would never notice. So I checked each of the answers and they were all correct except for the last one. We were to draw a flow chart for a process. I checked the answer sheet, "answers will vary." I drew my flow chart, tore off the answer sheet and walked to the front podium to turn the test in. When I got to the podium I had to know. I needed to see what everyone else had drawn for their flow chart. "answers will vary." Everyone had written that on their tests. I don't remember what the teacher did about it.


I found my love for opera in the strangest of places.
My mother was singing me a song one night when I asked her, "Mother, why do you sing?"
She looked puzzled for a moment, before telling me, "Why, I watched an opera performance under the light of the full moon and that must be where my love of singing came from."

This led me onto a quest to find this opera and join it.

The opera is a funny thing. Just like the rest of the world, it has beautiful history. A beautiful history
rittled with dark streaks. While Wagner's wedding march plays at most catholic weddings, it was written by
a man with a history of racist, anti-semetic behaviour. This man controlled the entire opera scene until 
modern atonal music began to come about, ironically by people like Mahler and Schoenberg. Jewish composers.

Anyways, I can't wait to find one to sing in.

Ending: In the sanctuary, JJ Lin is his own king.
